My name is **Bitu Talukdar**, but you can call me **Shree Bitu**.
I am 20 years old, and I want to be a developer.


I first discovered coding around **2018**, when I was just 16–17 years old.
My brother had a government laptop (**HP 245 AMD A6**), and that small machine opened a **whole new world** for me.

That was where I learned my first lines of **HTML and CSS**… and I fell in love with coding instantly ❤️

But life had different plans.

In **2021**, the laptop display broke.
buying a new laptop was very difficult.
Slowly… my coding dream faded away.

During COVID, I passed Class 10 with 55% (SEBA), but I lost interest in studies.
I completed Class 12 with 56% in Science, then joined B.Sc (Botany Major)…
But my heart was never there.


Eventually, I left college and started a private job,
And finally…
Now I bought my own laptop💻🔥

That moment changed everything.
