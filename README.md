## 🌟 About Me

My name is **Bitu Talukdar**, but you can call me **Shree Bitu**.
I am 20 years old, and I am on a mission to become a great developer.

My journey in programming is not easy… but it is real, emotional, and powerful.

I first discovered coding around **2018**, when I was just 16–17 years old.
My brother had a government laptop (**HP 245 AMD A6**), and that small machine opened a **whole new world** for me.

That was where I learned my first lines of **HTML and CSS**… and I fell in love with coding instantly ❤️

But life had different plans.

In **2021**, the laptop display broke.
My father works as a daily wage laborer, so buying a new laptop was very difficult.
Slowly… my coding dream faded away.

During COVID, I passed Class 10, but I lost interest in studies.
I completed Class 12 with 56% in Science, then joined B.Sc (Botany Major)…
But my heart was never there.

All I could think about was one thing:

💭 *“When will I get a laptop again?”*

Eventually, I left college and started a private job earning ₹8500/month.
But even while working… my dream never died.

And finally…
I bought my own laptop (**Infinix Y1 Neo**) on EMI 💻🔥

That moment changed everything.
